This Python project implements a simple slot machine game where players can deposit an initial balance, spin the slot machine, and try to win prizes. Features include multiple betting lines (up to three), adjustable bet amounts ($1 to $100), randomized spins, and winnings calculation based on matching symbols. Error handling ensures valid user inputs. The main.py script manages user interactions, while slot_machine.py contains the core game logic. Players can customize their bets and view their balance as they play. Contributions are welcome via pull requests
